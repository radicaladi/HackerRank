^ asserts position at start of the string
1st Capturing Group ([aeiou])
.* matches any character (except newline) - between zero and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy)
\1 matches the same text as most recently matched by the 1st capturing group
$ asserts position at the end of the string
